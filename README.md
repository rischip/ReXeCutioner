# ReXeCutioner
XCMD with new visual features

ReXeCutioner is a version of Xcmd.exe that I modified in 2005-2006 timeframe. Xcmd had remote functionality, but was invisible on the remote Window Station.
I added functionality to make programs run visible on the remote Window Station. 

Here's an article about the original version. (This link does not belong to me.) I will do a write up sometime.
